IsoTools Extensions
===================

Extended functionality for [IsoTools2](https://github.com/HerwigLab/IsoTools2)
package for gene transcript isoform analysis. Specifically, it implements new
tests for alternative last/first exon usage (ALE, AFE) that is separate from
alternative polyadenylation site or transcription start site (PAS, TSS)
testing. In the original IsoTools package the available tests for PAS/TSS
conflated them with ALE/AFE, which are distinct phenomena.

This package relies on a [fork](https://github.com/kbseah/IsoTools2) that
implements some bug fixes not yet incorporated into the upstream repository.

Please cite the original IsoTools papers and this repository if you use it.
